List of available commands:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

help              Displays the user manual
dir <directory>   Display contents of the current project directory
printenv or env   Lists all environmental strings
echo <comment>    Displays comment on the command line followed by a newline
cd <path>         Changes the working directory to the specified path
clear             Clear all text in the terminal 
quit or exit      Quits the shell

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shell also supports i/o-redirection on either or both  stdin and/or stdout. That is,  the command line 

programname arg1 arg2 < inputfile > outputfile 

will execute the program programname with arguments arg1 and arg2,  the stdin FILE stream replaced by inputfile and the stdout FILE stream replaced by outputfile. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shell also supports background execution of programs. An ampersand (&) at the end of the command line indicates that the shell should return to the command line prompt immediately after launching 
that program.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The shell also supports pipe handling. The Unix/Linux systems allow stdout of a command to be connected to stdin of another command. You can make it do so by using the pipe character ‘|’. 
Syntax : 

command_1 | command_2 | command_3 | .... | command_N
